# RFP2205-MVP Project

Hi and welcome to From Scratch! For this project we were only given 4 days and I created this fun basic social media ios app that anybody can share/post/save their homemade recipes!

## Features
Once you are logged in it will first show a loading page then take you to the Home Page.

In this Home Page you are able to scroll through the feed based on people you follow. If you click on the picture you can see a list of ingreidents and steps for that specific recipe. If you would like to save the recipe you can click on the pink notebook on the bottom right and it will save in the saved navigation tab in the bottom

We could also look at other profiles and see whether you follow them. You also have the ability to follow/unfollow as well.

## Caveats

Because this project was completed in only 4 days there is still a lot that needs to be improved on. Some known issues:
- The database uses Mongo but I would like to re-create it to PostgresSQL to create relational tables and possibly scale my DB
- I did not create a new account features if the user is signing up for the first time 
- The app is also not implementing authentication system.

Please check back at a later date for additional features. I will still be continuing this project.
