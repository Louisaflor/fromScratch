# RFP2205-MVP Project

Hi and welcome to From Scratch! For this project we were only given 4 days and I created this fun basic social media ios app that anybody can share/post/save their homemade recipes!

## Features
Once you are logged in it will first show a loading page then take you to the Home Page.

In this Home Page you are able to scroll throught the feed based on people you follow. If you click on the picture you can see a list of ingreidents and steps for that specific recipe. If you would like to save the recipe you can click on the pink notebook on the bottom right and it will save in the saved navigation tab in the bottom
